# Sales-prediction

### Problem: Predict the sales of the 300th day and 500th day with the data given. Here are the data:

1. The graph below implies that as the day increases, the sales decreases at a stable pace. Statistics also show this strong correlation.

2. A statistical model is used to describe such correlation. Looking at the graph below, the red line represents the statistical model which shows the general descending trend of the sales. This model  will be used to predict the sales for 300th and 500th day.

3. The prediction of sales for the 300th day is -0.24 million and -1.02 million for 500th day, which is why the red highlighted data points are below the 0 axis. However, it doesn't mean that the sales are going to be negative and it is just a mathematical prediction. If no business strategies are implemented to boost the sales, they will decrease drastically compared to Day 1.
